# Fink Packages

## About

This package contains some Fink project files that I created.

## Usage

To use these files in your fink distribution, copy the .info and .patch file
(if applicable) related to the package of your choice to
`/sw/fink/10.4/local/main/finkinfo`, and run
	
		fink install <mypackage>

(where `<mypackage>` is replaced by the package of your choice)
